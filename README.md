# Face Detection & Emotion Recognition with DeepFace 

This project uses OpenCV and DeepFace to detect faces and recognize emotions in real-time from webcam video. It combines classical face detection (Haar cascades) with deep learning-based emotion analysis.

## Demo

> Real-time video stream with face detection and emotion labels on top of each face using your webcam.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades
- Emotion analysis using `DeepFace`
- Overlay dominant emotion on each detected face
- Simple and lightweight â€” runs directly from your webcam
